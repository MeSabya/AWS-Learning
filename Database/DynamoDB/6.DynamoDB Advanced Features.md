## DynamoDB TTL

- DynamoDB Time to Live (TTL) enables a per-item timestamp to determine when an item is no longer needed.
- After the date and time of the specified timestamp, DynamoDB deletes the item from the table without consuming any write throughput.
- DynamoDB TTL is provided at no extra cost and can help reduce the data storage by retaining only required data.
- Items are deleted from the table are also removed from any local secondary index and global secondary index in the same way as a DeleteItem operation.

## DynamoDB Cross-region Replication
- DynamoDB cross-region replication allows identical copies (called replicas) of a DynamoDB table (called master table) to be maintained in one or more AWS regions
- Writes to the table will be automatically propagated to all replicas
- Cross-region replication currently supports single master mode. A single master has one master table and one or more replica tables
- Read replicas are updated asynchronously as DynamoDB acknowledges a write operation as successful once it has been accepted by the master table.
-  The write will then be propagated to each replica with a slight delay.

## DynamoDB Global Tables
- DynamoDB Global Tables is a new multi-master, cross-region replication capability of DynamoDB to support data access locality and regional fault tolerance for database workloads.
- Applications can now perform reads and writes to DynamoDB in AWS regions around the world, with changes in any region propagated to every region where a table is replicated.
- Global Tables help in building applications to advantage of data locality to reduce overall latency.
- Global Tables ensures eventual consistency.
- Global Tables replicates data among regions within a single AWS account, and currently does not support cross account access
- Global Tables requires DynamoDB streams enabled with New and Old image setting 

## DynamoDB Streams

- DynamoDB Streams provides a time-ordered sequence of item-level changes made to data in a table.
- DynamoDB Streams stores the data for last 24 hours, after which they are erased.
- DynamoDB Streams maintains ordered sequence of the events per item however sequence across item are not maintained.
- DynamoDB Streams have to be enabled on a per-table basis.
- DynamoDB Streams is designed for No Duplicates, so that every update made to the table will be represented exactly once in the stream.
- DynamoDB streams can be used for multi-region replication to keep other data stores up-to-date with the latest changes to DynamoDB or to take actions based on the changes made to the table
