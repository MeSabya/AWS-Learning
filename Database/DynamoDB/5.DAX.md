- DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a fully managed, highly available, in-memory cache for DynamoDB that delivers up to a 10x performance improvement â€“ from milliseconds to microseconds â€“ even at millions of requests per second.
- DAX is intended for high-performance reads application. As a write-through cache, DAX writes directly so that the writes are immediately reflected in the item cache.
- DAX as a managed service handles the cache invalidation, data population, or cluster management.
- DAX saves cost reducing the read load (RCU) on DynamoDB
- DAX helps prevent hot partitions
- DAX only supports eventual consistency, and strong consistency requests are passed-through to DynamoDB.
- DAX is fault-tolerant and scalable.
- DAX cluster has a primary node and zero or more read-replica nodes. Upon a failure for a primary node, DAX will automatically fail over and elect a new primary. For scaling, add or remove read replicas.
- DAX supports server-side encryption.
- DAX does not support Transport Layer Security (TLS).

## DynamoDB Accelerator Operations

### Eventual Read operations

If DAX has the item available (a cache hit), DAX returns the item without accessing DynamoDB.

If DAX does not have the item available (a cache miss), DAX passes the request through to DynamoDB. When it receives the response from DynamoDB, DAX returns the results to the application. But it also writes the results to the cache on the primary node.

### Strongly Consistent Read operations

DAX passes the request through to DynamoDB. The results from DynamoDB are not cached in DAX. but simply returned

### For Write operations

Data is first written to the DynamoDB table, and then to the DAX cluster.

Operation is successful only if the data is successfully written to both the table and to DAX.

## DynamoDB Accelerator Caches

DAX cluster has two distinct caches â€“ Item cache and Query cache

ðŸ‘‰ Item Cache â€” Used to store results of GetItem and BatchGetItem operations

ðŸ‘‰ Query Cache â€”Used to store results of Query and Scan operations

## DynamoDB Accelerator Write Strategies

1. Write-Through
2. Write-Around


## When can we use them together Elastic-cache and DAX ?
