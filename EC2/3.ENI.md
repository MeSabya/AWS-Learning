# What Are AWS Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs), and How Do You Use Them?

- *ENIs are virtual network cards you can attach to your EC2 instances. They are used to enable network connectivity for your instances, and having more than one of them connected to your instance allows it to communicate on two different subnets.*
- ENIs are bound to a specific AZ.
- An ENI can have following attributes:
  1. One primary IP , one or more secondary IPV4 addresses.
  2. One Elastic IP for per private IPV4.
  3. One public IPV4.
  4. One or more security groups.
  5. A MAC address.
