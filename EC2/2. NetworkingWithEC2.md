## IP addresses

There are three types of IP address that can be assigned to an Amazon EC2 instance:

ğŸ‘‰ Public: A public address is assigned automatically to instances in public subnets and is reassigned if an instance is stopped/started.

ğŸ‘‰ Private: A private address is assigned automatically to all instances.

ğŸ‘‰ Elastic: This is a public address that is static.
