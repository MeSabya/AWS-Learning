### EKS Control plane and node groups

ðŸ‘‰ EKS worker nodes running our AWS account , connect to our clusters control plane via cluster API server endpoint.

So now here what we need to understand is this cluster server API endpoint should be exposed to the internet.

Our worker node should be accessed internally to the VPC using this cluster API server endpoint or our worker nodes need to go via internet and then access this APIs server endpoint.

These are design strategies how we are going to design our EKS cluster.

ðŸ‘‰ One more important thing here is all instances in a node group must be of same instance style be running the same AMI

and use the same EKS worker node IAM role. So all these are core things, okay But do we need to worry about all these things here?

No. So when we use the EKS CTL command line most of the things are achieved directly out of the box.

We don't need to worry about worker node IAM role or running the same AMI or running the same instance there.

All these things are automatically taken care with EKS CTL.
