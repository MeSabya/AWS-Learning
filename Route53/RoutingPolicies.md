# Routing policies

Routing policies determine how Route 53 responds to queries. The following table highlights the key function of each type of routing policy:

ðŸ‘‰ Simple Routing: redirect to single resource, canâ€™t attach health check, If multiple records are attached, random one will be selected.

ðŸ‘‰ Weighted Routing: Weighted Routing Policy controls the what percentage % of the requests that go to specific endpoint. Itâ€™s helpful to test 1% of traffic on new app version. It is also helpful to split traffic between two regions. We can associate Health checks with it.

ðŸ‘‰ Latency Routing: redirect to the server that has the least latency close to us, latency is calculated in terms to AWS Region, health check attached.

ðŸ‘‰ Failover Routing: If primary resource is not working, traffic is redirect to secondary instance/resource. Health check is mandatory.

ðŸ‘‰ Geo-location Routing: routing is based on user location. Specify that, traffic from XYZ location should go always to particular instance/resource, if it doesnâ€™t match, should go to default policy(We define this also).

ðŸ‘‰ Multi-Value: Use when, traffic needs to go to multiple resources, health check mandatory. Itâ€™s not substitute for having an ELB.
