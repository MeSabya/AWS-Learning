## ECS - Dynamic Port Mapping

A popular function of containers is to run a service such as a web or application server to which clients connect to using HTTP, TCP or socket connections. By default, Docker will allocate a port from the host to the container from the ephemeral port range, but you can manually map or expose a specific host port, such as mapping port 80 on the host to port 8080 on the container. This works fine for individual containers and tasks, but if you need to run another container of the same type, you would then need another host as you cannot bind more than one container to a specific host port (i.e. if there is a container or service listening on a specific port such as port 80, no other service or container can use or bind that specific port.

Dynamic Port mapping would allow you to run multiple containers of the same type, on the same EC2 instance, effectively reducing cost and management overhead.

Setting up Dynamic Port Mapping
Dynamic Port Mapping is relatively easy to configure. From the ECS service side, all you need to do is set the "Host" port in the container mapping to "0". A JSON snippet of the task definition would therefore look like this:

```json
"portMappings": [
        {
          "hostPort": 0,
          "protocol": "tcp",
          "containerPort": 80
        }
      ]
```
