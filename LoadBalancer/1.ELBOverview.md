# AWS — Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) Overview

👉 AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones. 

👉 It monitors the health of its registered targets, and routes traffic only to the healthy targets. 

👉 Elastic Load Balancing scales your load balancer as your incoming traffic changes over time. It can automatically scale to the vast majority of workloads.

👉 ELB can manage traffic within a region and not across multiple regions.

👉 ELB does not have predefined IPv4 addresses, it is resolved using DNS name.

👉 To ensure that traffic is evenly distributed, you need to ensure the “Cross-Zone Load balancing” option is enabled.

## ELB Types
      1. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
      2. Network Load Balancer (NLB)
      3. Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)
      4. Classic Load Balancer (CLB)
      
## ELB Schemes

- Internet-facing: ELB nodes have public IP addresses.
- Internal: ELB nodes have private IP addresses.

For internet-facing load balancers, the IPv4 addresses of the nodes are assigned by AWS. For internal load balancers, the IPv4 addresses are assigned from the subnet CIDR.

>Both internet-facing and internal load balancers route requests to your targets using private IP addresses. Therefore, your targets do not need public IP addresses to receive requests from an internal or an internet-facing load balancer.      

## ELB Target Types
ELB distribute incoming traffic to:

        Instances (EC2, EC2 with Auto Scaling, Containers with ECS)
        IP addresses (VPC Subnets, RFC 1918 CIDR, On-premises with Direct Connect or Site-to-Site VPN)
        Lambda functions (for ALB type)
        
## ELB Components Architecture

### Listeners:
Listener checks for connection requests from clients, using the protocol and port that you configure.
Listener defines how your inbound connections are routed to your target groups based on rules.
For every load balancer, you must configure at least one listener.
ELB has more than one listeners. e.g. HTTP, HTTPS.

### Rules: 
The rules that you define for a listener determine how the load balancer routes requests to its registered targets.
Each rule consists of a priority, one or more actions, and one or more conditions.
Each listener has a default rule, and you can optionally define additional rules.

### Target Groups:
A target group is a group of resources that you want your ELB to route request to.
You can configure your ELB with a number of different target groups, each associated with different listener configuration and associated rules.
Each target group routes requests to one or more registered targets, such as EC2 instances, using the protocol and port number that you specify.
You can register a target with multiple target groups.

## Health Checks: 
To discover the availability of your targets (e.g. EC2 instances), a load balancer periodically sends pings, attempts connections, or sends requests to test the EC2 instances. These tests are called health checks.
