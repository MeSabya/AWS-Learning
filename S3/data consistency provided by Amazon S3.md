Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) offers various levels of data consistency to accommodate different use cases and requirements. These levels include:

## Read-after-Write Consistency (for PUTs of new objects):
When a new object is uploaded (PUT) to Amazon S3, it provides read-after-write consistency for all requests. 
This means that as soon as the PUT request completes successfully, subsequent GET requests for that object will return the newly uploaded data.
Appropriate for applications where immediate access to newly uploaded data is critical, such as real-time data processing or file sharing applications.

## Eventual Consistency (for overwrite PUTs and DELETEs):
After a successful overwrite PUT or DELETE operation on an existing object, Amazon S3 may exhibit eventual consistency. 
This means that while the operation is eventually propagated across all replicas, there might be a slight delay before all GET requests reflect the change.
Suitable for scenarios where immediate consistency is not required, such as data backups, log storage, or non-critical data storage.

## Read-after-Write Consistency with Bucket Versioning:
When bucket versioning is enabled, Amazon S3 provides read-after-write consistency for all PUTs and DELETEs of objects 
and their metadata. Each version of the object gets a unique identifier, ensuring that even if an object is overwritten or deleted, previous versions remain accessible.
Useful for applications requiring strict data consistency and the ability to retrieve previous versions of objects, such as compliance or auditing systems.
