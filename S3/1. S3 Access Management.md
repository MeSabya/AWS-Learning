## IAM user policies
IAM policies are JSON or YAML-based policies that help us control users' access to AWS services and resources. For example, the policy below allows 
fetching objects from the S3 bucket named my-bucket. If we attach it to a user, the user can have access to all objects in my-bucket.

```yaml
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
        }
    ]
}
```
These permissions can be attached to the users, groups, and roles allowed to access the bucket’s objects. Although IAM policies are simpler to manage when controlling access to multiple buckets, managing them for cross-account users can be difficult as we would need other IAM resources besides the policies.
Similarly, if we want to give access to external identities, we cannot attach any IAM permissions or roles to them.

To cater to these limitations and manage access permissions at the resource level, we have resource-based policies.


## Resource-based policies (S3 Bucket policy)

Resource-based policies allow you to define permissions at the bucket or object level. 
These policies are written in JSON and provide fine-grained access control for users, roles, or accounts that interact with your S3 resources.

### Key Features:

- Granular Control: Resource-based policies offer detailed permission settings, allowing you to specify who can access resources, what actions they can perform, and under what conditions (e.g., based on IP address or time).
- Cross-Account Access: Allows you to grant cross-account access (i.e., allow AWS accounts other than the owner to access resources in your S3 bucket).
- Conditionals: You can add conditional checks (e.g., allow access only from a specific IP range or VPC).
- Applied to Buckets/Objects: You can attach policies to either the bucket level (affecting all objects in the bucket) or individual objects.
- Integration with IAM: You can use it in conjunction with AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies for even more fine-tuned access control.

```yaml
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:user/my-user"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
The bucket policy looks similar to the IAM policy. However, notice the Principal element on lines 8–10. It determines who the policy 
applies to and distinguishes resource-based policy from other IAM policies. This policy only allows the IAM user my-user to access the bucket. 
We can allow external entities to access the bucket by using a wildcard in the principal element such as shown below:

```shell
"Principal": "*"
```
## Access grants
As the user base and number of prefixes in a bucket increase, it can become difficult to manage access permissions. 
For example, if we have a data lake consisting of multiple folders accessed by multiple resources, 
it can be difficult to add policies to the bucket for each user group. Also, creating IAM roles for each user group can be 
difficult to manage. Besides, the maximum limit for IAM policies is 200 KB.

To cater to these limitations, S3 has released a new access mechanism called S3 Access Grants. 
S3 Access Grants refer to the permissions and privileges assigned to different entities, such as users, 
groups, or services, to perform specific actions on 
S3 buckets and objects. They manage access permissions at a more granular level and support corporate directories.

## Block public access
S3 buckets have a configuration called Block Public Access that enables us to manage access to buckets, access points, and accounts. This feature adds another layer of security to the bucket and applies to the external entities as well. By default, the block public access is enabled. Therefore, new buckets, access points, and objects do not allow public access. Block public access provides four settings to manage access.
