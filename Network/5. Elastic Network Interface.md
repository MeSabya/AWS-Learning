# What is Elastic Network Interface?

*Essentially, ENIs are virtual network cards you can attach to your EC2 instances. They are used to enable network connectivity for your instances, and having more than one of them connected to your instance allows it to communicate on two different subnets.*

## What is ENI?
Definition: An Elastic Network Interface is a logical networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card. It can have one or more private IP addresses, one or more Elastic IP addresses (IPv4), and can be associated with security groups and a MAC address.

### Components:

- Primary Private IP Address: Automatically assigned to the ENI when it is created.
- Secondary Private IP Addresses: Additional private IPs that you can assign to the ENI.
- Elastic IP Addresses: Public IPs that can be associated with the ENI for internet access.
- Security Groups: Controls inbound and outbound traffic to the ENI.

### Problems ENIs Solve

#### Network Isolation and Security:

ENIs allow for greater control over network traffic. By assigning different ENIs to instances, you can segment network traffic for different applications, improving security.

#### Dynamic IP Address Management:

You can attach and detach ENIs from instances, allowing you to dynamically manage IP addresses. This is particularly useful for applications that require different IPs for different functionalities.

#### High Availability and Failover:

By using ENIs, you can maintain high availability. If an instance fails, you can detach its ENI and attach it to a new instance in the same availability zone, minimizing downtime.

#### Multiple Network Interfaces:

You can attach multiple ENIs to a single instance, allowing the instance to have multiple private IP addresses. This is useful for applications that need to handle different types of traffic (e.g., management traffic vs. application traffic).

#### Elastic Load Balancing:

ENIs are often used in conjunction with load balancers. They allow instances behind a load balancer to respond to traffic from multiple subnets or VPCs, facilitating better distribution of traffic.

#### Connecting to Multiple VPCs:

ENIs can facilitate the connectivity of an instance to multiple VPCs or on-premises networks through AWS Direct Connect or VPN connections, making hybrid cloud architectures easier to implement.

#### Custom Network Configuration:

ENIs allow for the customization of network settings. You can configure security groups, IP addressing, and routing based on specific application needs.

#### Simplified Network Management:

By using ENIs, you can simplify the management of network interfaces and IP addresses, making it easier to change network configurations without needing to modify instance configurations directly.

#### Monitoring and Logging:

ENIs can be monitored using Amazon CloudWatch, allowing for better insights into network traffic patterns and performance metrics.

### Use Cases
- Web Applications: Hosting web applications that require public and private subnets for enhanced security.
- Microservices: Separating different services into distinct ENIs for improved manageability and security.
- Database Instances: Isolating database traffic from application traffic for performance optimization.

## ENI — Key Features
- Each instance in your VPC has a default network interface (the primary network interface — eth0) that assigns a private IPv4 address from the IPv4 address range of your VPC (See Figure 1).
- You cannot detach the default (primary) network interface from an instance.
- You can create an attach an additional/ secondary ENIs to an instance in your VPC. However, these ENIs should be created within the same availability zone of the EC2 instance that you are trying to attach your secondary ENI (See Figure 2). The number of network instances you can attach varies by instance type.
- A Security Group is attached to an ENI not an EC2 instance. With this approach you can have multiple routes to the same EC2 instance with different security configurations.
- You can create a network interface, attach it to an instance, detach it from an instance and attach it to another instance within the same Availability Zone. A network interface’s attributes follow it as it is attached or detached from an instance and reattached to another instance. When you move a network interface from one instance to another, network traffic is redirected to the new instance.
- Network Interface is a network card for the virtual machine, multiple ENI's can be attached to a single EC2 instance.
- By default, it gives you a private IPv4 address, you can choose to attach an Elastic IP for a Public IPv4 address.
- While attaching ENI's to EC2 instances, make sure to have your EC2 Instance in the same subnet as ENI.
- You will charged for an Elastic IP Address that is associated with a network interface but the network interface isn’t attached to a running instance.
- You can attach and detach secondary interfaces (eth1-ethn) on an EC2 instance, but you can’t detach the eth0 interface.

## Common Usecase

**UseCase1:**
A common use case for ENIs is the creation of management networks. This allows you to have public-facing applications like web servers in a public subnet but lock down SSH access down to a private subnet on a secondary network interface. In this scenario, you would connect using a VPN to the private management subnet, then administrate your servers as usual.

In this diagram, the subnet on the left is the public subnet, which communicates with the internet over the Internet Gateway for the VPC. The subnet on the right is the private management subnet, which can only be accessed in this example by the AWS Direct Connect gateway, which allows the on-premises network to handle authentication, and simply extends that network into the cloud.

**UseCase2**:
ENIs are also often used as the primary network interfaces for Docker containers launched on ECS using Fargate. This allows Fargate tasks to handle complex networking, set firewalls in place using security groups, and be launched into private subnets.
