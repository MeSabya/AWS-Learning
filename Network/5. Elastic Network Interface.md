# What is Elastic Network Interface?

If an EC2 instance is a virtual computer, an ENI is its network card — the part that connects it to the VPC and internet.

## What is ENI?
An Elastic Network Interface (ENI) is a virtual network card in AWS that you can attach to EC2 instances in your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). 
It represents a network interface with:

- A private IPv4 address (mandatory)
- An optional public IPv4 address
- A MAC address
- One or more security groups
- One or more secondary private IP addresses
- A source/destination check setting
- A description
- An attachment to an EC2 instance (optional)

### Problems ENIs Solve
- Multi-Networking: Attach multiple ENIs to a single EC2 instance for access to different subnets or VLANs.

  <details>
  
  An EC2 instance can connect to multiple subnets in the same VPC using multiple Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs).
  How?

  Each ENI is associated with a single subnet.

  You can attach multiple ENIs to a single EC2 instance, each in a different subnet (but within the same VPC).

  This allows the EC2 instance to communicate over different subnets (e.g., one for public access, another for private DB access).

  Example:
  
  ```
  ENI	Subnet	Purpose
  eth0	10.0.1.0/24 (public)	Internet access
  eth1	10.0.2.0/24 (private)	DB access
  ```
  
</details>
  
- Security Segmentation: Apply different security groups to different ENIs for fine-grained traffic control.
- High Availability: Move ENIs across instances in the same AZ to recover quickly from instance failure.

  <details>
    You have an EC2-based application server with a known Elastic IP and security group rules. If that server crashes:
    
    Launch a new EC2 instance in the same AZ.
    
    Attach the existing ENI to it.

     The new instance immediately gets the same IP, MAC, and security posture, and traffic resumes with minimal interruption.
   </details>

- Traffic Isolation: Separate management, application, and data traffic using different ENIs.
- Elastic IP Portability: Keep a consistent public IP (Elastic IP) by moving the ENI to a new instance.

### Use Cases
- Web Applications: Hosting web applications that require public and private subnets for enhanced security.
- Microservices: Separating different services into distinct ENIs for improved manageability and security.
- Database Instances: Isolating database traffic from application traffic for performance optimization.

## ENI — Key Features
- Each instance in your VPC has a default network interface (the primary network interface — eth0) that assigns a private IPv4 address from the IPv4 address range of your VPC (See Figure 1).
- You cannot detach the default (primary) network interface from an instance.
- You can create an attach an additional/ secondary ENIs to an instance in your VPC. However, these ENIs should be created within the same availability zone of the EC2 instance that you are trying to attach your secondary ENI (See Figure 2). The number of network instances you can attach varies by instance type.
- A Security Group is attached to an ENI not an EC2 instance. With this approach you can have multiple routes to the same EC2 instance with different security configurations.
- You can create a network interface, attach it to an instance, detach it from an instance and attach it to another instance within the same Availability Zone. A network interface’s attributes follow it as it is attached or detached from an instance and reattached to another instance. When you move a network interface from one instance to another, network traffic is redirected to the new instance.
- Network Interface is a network card for the virtual machine, multiple ENI's can be attached to a single EC2 instance.
- By default, it gives you a private IPv4 address, you can choose to attach an Elastic IP for a Public IPv4 address.
- While attaching ENI's to EC2 instances, make sure to have your EC2 Instance in the same subnet as ENI.
- You will charged for an Elastic IP Address that is associated with a network interface but the network interface isn’t attached to a running instance.
- You can attach and detach secondary interfaces (eth1-ethn) on an EC2 instance, but you can’t detach the eth0 interface.

## Common Usecase

**UseCase1:**
A common use case for ENIs is the creation of management networks. This allows you to have public-facing applications like web servers in a public subnet but lock down SSH access down to a private subnet on a secondary network interface. In this scenario, you would connect using a VPN to the private management subnet, then administrate your servers as usual.

In this diagram, the subnet on the left is the public subnet, which communicates with the internet over the Internet Gateway for the VPC. The subnet on the right is the private management subnet, which can only be accessed in this example by the AWS Direct Connect gateway, which allows the on-premises network to handle authentication, and simply extends that network into the cloud.

**UseCase2**:
ENIs are also often used as the primary network interfaces for Docker containers launched on ECS using Fargate. This allows Fargate tasks to handle complex networking, set firewalls in place using security groups, and be launched into private subnets.
