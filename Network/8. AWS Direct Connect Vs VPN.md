AWS Direct Connect provides dedicated, private network connections between on-premises data centers or networks and AWS, bypassing the public internet. 
Direct Connect establishes private connectivity via dedicated physical connections, such as Ethernet or fiber-optic cables, between the customer's network and AWS Direct 
Connect locations (known as Direct Connect Gateway or DXGW). This dedicated connection ensures a consistent network experience with predictable performance, 
low latency, and enhanced security for data transfer.

In contrast, Site-to-Site VPN (Virtual Private Network) uses the public internet to establish encrypted tunnels between an on-premises VPN gateway and a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) 
in the AWS VPC. Site-to-Site VPN tunnels encrypt traffic traversing the public internet, providing secure communication between the on-premises network and AWS VPCs. However, because 
Site-to-Site VPN traffic travels over the public internet, it may experience variable performance, latency, and potential security risks associated with internet connectivity.

## AWS Direct Connect advantages over AWS Site-to-Site VPN
AWS VPN offers encrypted connectivity, but what it doesn’t usually offer is low latency or a consistent network experience, since the public Internet is a shared network, and therefore unpredictable.

AWS VPN connectivity isn’t very scalable since VPN tunnels are limited to a maximum bandwidth of 1.25 Gbps.

This is where AWS Direct Connect helps. You can get high scalability connections up to 100 Gbps. Since the connections are dedicated, you get higher and more consistent network performance and greater inherent security in accessing your AWS resources.

## AWS Site-to-Site VPN advantages over AWS Direct Connect

AWS Site-to-Site VPN provides high availability by default by using two tunnels that span multiple availability zones within the AWS global network. You can stream the main traffic through the first tunnel and use the second tunnel as redundancy meaning if one tunnel fails, the traffic will continue to flow. If you need to achieve this when using AWS Direct Connect, you need to create two or more AWS Direct Connect connections or create a failover backup connection using AWS VPN.

Deployment of AWS Site-to-Site VPN is easy and doesn’t take as much time as AWS Direct Connect. It also uses IP security (IPsec) to establish secure and private sessions.
