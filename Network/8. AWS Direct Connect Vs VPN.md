AWS Direct Connect provides dedicated, private network connections between on-premises data centers or networks and AWS, bypassing the public internet. 
Direct Connect establishes private connectivity via dedicated physical connections, such as Ethernet or fiber-optic cables, between the customer's network and AWS Direct 
Connect locations (known as Direct Connect Gateway or DXGW). This dedicated connection ensures a consistent network experience with predictable performance, 
low latency, and enhanced security for data transfer.

In contrast, Site-to-Site VPN (Virtual Private Network) uses the public internet to establish encrypted tunnels between an on-premises VPN gateway and a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) 
in the AWS VPC. Site-to-Site VPN tunnels encrypt traffic traversing the public internet, providing secure communication between the on-premises network and AWS VPCs. However, because 
Site-to-Site VPN traffic travels over the public internet, it may experience variable performance, latency, and potential security risks associated with internet connectivity.
