# VPC Endpoints:
VPC endpoint enables creation of a private connection between VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink using its private IP address. Traffic between VPC and AWS service does not leave the Amazon network.

## AWS Private Link vs VPC Endpoint

- VPC endpoint ‚Äî The entry point in your VPC that enables you to connect privately to a service.

- AWS PrivateLink ‚Äî A technology that provides private connectivity between VPCs and services.

So PrivateLink is technology allowing you to privately (without Internet) access services in VPCs. These services can be your own, or provided by AWS.

Let's say that you've developed some application and you are hosting it in your VPC. You would like to enable access to this application to services in other VPCs and other AWS users/accounts. But you don't want to setup any VPC peering nor use Internet for that. This is where PrivateLink can be used. Using PrivateLink you can create your own VPC endpoint services which will enable other services to use your application.

üëâ There are two types of VPC endpoints:

- Use **Gateway Endpoint** if the AWS service is either DynamoDB or S3.
- Use **Interface Endpoint** for everything else.

üëâ **Know which services use interface endpoints and gateway endpoints. The easiest way to remember this is that gateway endpoints are for Amazon S3 and DynamoDB only.**

## Interface Endpoint

In the figure below, I need to connect the EC2 instance to the SQS through the private network. To establish an interface endpoint, I create an endpoint network interface in the same subnet as the EC2 instance and attach a security group with proper access permission to this endpoint networking interface. After the interface endpoint is created, the service provider will need to accept it. Generally speaking, AWS services will accept all endpoint request automatically.

## Gateway Endpoint:

Gateway endpoint is a little bit different. In the figure below, the gateway endpoint is created at the VPC level. I need to attach an endpoint policy  to the gateway endpoint that allow access to the S3 service and also specify a route in the route table in subnet 10.18.0.0 so the EC2 instance can find a path to the S3 bucket.

## VPC Endpoints Key points
1. VPC endpoint enables users to privately connect their VPC to supported AWS services.
2. VPC Endpoint does not require a public IP address, access over the Internet, NAT device, a VPN connection or AWS Direct Connect to communicate with resources in the service.
3. Endpoints are virtual devices, that are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components that allow communication between instances in the VPC.
4. Access to the resources in other services can be controlled by endpoint policies.
5. By default, Endpoint policy, allows full access to the service. Endpoint policies must be written in JSON format.
6. Endpoint policy does not override or replace IAM user policies or service-specific policies (such as S3 bucket policies).

## VPC Endpoints Limitations
1. VPC endpoints support IPv4 traffic only.
2. Endpoints are supported within the same Region only. You cannot create an endpoint between a VPC and a service in a different Region.
3. Endpoints cannot transfer an endpoint from one VPC to another, or from one service to another.


# Shared Services VPCs

VPC sharing enables subnets to be shared with other AWS accounts within the same AWS Organization. Benefits include:

- Separation of duties: centrally controlled VPC structure, routing, IP address allocation.
- Application owners continue to own resources, accounts, and security groups.
- VPC sharing participants can reference security group IDs of each other.
- Efficiencies: higher density in subnets, efficient use of VPNs, and AWS Direct Connect.
- Hard limits (for example, 50 VIFs per AWS Direct Connect connection through simplified network architecture) can be avoided.
- Costs can be optimized through the reuse of NAT gateways, VPC interface endpoints, and intra-Availability Zone traffic.
- You can create separate Amazon VPCs for each account, with the account owner being responsible for the connectivity and security of each Amazon VPC.

## Questions For practice

```Lua
An organization in the health industry needs to create an application that will transmit protected health 
data to thousands of service consumers in different AWS accounts. The application servers are run on EC2 instances in private VPC subnets. 
The routing for the application must be fault-tolerant.

What should be done to meet these requirements?

1. Create a virtual private gateway connection between each pair of service provider VPCs and service consumer VPCs.
2. Create a proxy server in the service provider VPC to route requests from service consumers to the application servers.
3. Create a VPC endpoint service, and grant permissions to specific service consumers to create a connection.
4. Create an internal Application Load Balancer in the service provider VPC, and put application servers behind it.
```

**Explanations**:

Explanation: Here you need to offer the service through a service provider offering. This is a great use case for a VPC endpoint service using AWS PrivateLink (referred to as an endpoint service). Other AWS principals can then create a connection from their VPC to your endpoint service using an interface VPC endpoint.

You are acting as the service provider and offering the service to service consumers. This configuration uses a Network Load Balancer and can be fault-tolerant by configuring multiple subnets in which the EC2 instances are running.

The following diagram depicts a similar architecture:

INCORRECT: ‚ÄúCreate a virtual private gateway connection between each pair of service provider VPCs and service consumer VPCs.‚Äù is incorrect. Creating a virtual private gateway connection between each pair of service provider VPCs and service consumer VPCs would be extremely cumbersome and is not the best option.

INCORRECT: ‚ÄúCreate a proxy server in the service provider VPC to route requests from service consumers to the application servers.‚Äù is incorrect. Using a proxy service is possible but would not scale well and would present a single point of failure ‚Äî unless there is some load balancing ‚Äî to multiple proxies (not mentioned).

CORRECT: ‚ÄúCreate a VPC endpoint service, and grant permissions to specific service consumers to create a connection.‚Äù is the correct answer.

INCORRECT: ‚ÄúCreate an internal Application Load Balancer in the service provider VPC, and put application servers behind it.‚Äù is incorrect. Creating an internal ALB would not work because you need consumers from outside your VPC to be able to connect.
