### VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):

- A VPC is a virtual network that allows you to define and control your own IP address range, subnets, route tables, and network gateways.
- A VPC spans multiple availability zones within a specific AWS region.
- It allows you to launch AWS resources like EC2 instances within a logically isolated virtual network that you define.

### Subnets:

- A subnet is a range of IP addresses within your VPC. You can divide your VPC into multiple subnets.
- A subnet is associated with a single availability zone (AZ). Therefore, each subnet resides in one and only one AZ.
- Subnets can be either public (connected to the internet via an internet gateway) or private (without direct internet access).

### Availability Zones (AZs):

- An availability zone (AZ) is a physically separate data center within an AWS region. Each region typically has multiple availability zones for redundancy and high availability.
- Resources like subnets are deployed within a specific AZ to improve fault tolerance (i.e., a failure in one AZ will not affect resources in another AZ).

### Relationship Summary:
- A VPC can have multiple subnets, each of which is tied to one availability zone.
- A subnet is contained within one AZ, but a VPC itself can span multiple AZs within the region.
- By spreading resources across multiple subnets in different AZs, you can create a highly available and fault-tolerant architecture within your VPC.

### Example:
Letâ€™s say you have a VPC in the us-east-1 region, which has three availability zones (AZs):

us-east-1a
us-east-1b
us-east-1c
You can create a VPC (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16) and split it into multiple subnets:

Subnet A in us-east-1a (10.0.1.0/24),
Subnet B in us-east-1b (10.0.2.0/24),
Subnet C in us-east-1c (10.0.3.0/24).
Each subnet is isolated to a specific AZ, but all are part of the same VPC.

Why This Structure Matters:
High Availability: By deploying resources in subnets across different AZs, you can ensure that if one AZ goes down, resources in other AZs are unaffected.
Fault Tolerance: Subnet-A in AZ us-east-1a might be affected by a failure in that AZ, but Subnet-B in AZ us-east-1b will continue to operate normally.
