## What is an Egress-Only Internet Gateway?
- It is an AWS VPC component that allows IPv6 traffic from instances in your VPC to access the internet outbound only.
- Unlike IPv4, IPv6 addresses in AWS are globally routable by default — meaning they can talk directly to the internet.
- The Egress-Only Internet Gateway lets your IPv6-enabled instances send requests to the internet, but blocks any unsolicited inbound IPv6 traffic coming from the internet.
- It acts like a NAT Gateway but for IPv6, since NAT doesn’t apply to IPv6 in AWS.

## Key points:
- Works only with IPv6 traffic.
- Provides outbound-only internet access (egress) from IPv6-enabled instances in private subnets.
- Blocks any incoming unsolicited IPv6 traffic, enhancing security.
- Must be attached to your VPC.
- You need to update the route table of private subnets to send IPv6 default traffic (::/0) to the Egress-Only Internet Gateway.
