# Stateful and Stateless Firewalls
Stateful firewalls view the data flow request and response as a single stream. If we permit request or inbound access to a certain resource within a stateful firewall, the response or outbound access for the same request is automatically permitted from that resource. In AWS, the security groups act as stateful firewalls.

Stateless firewalls view the data flow request and response as two different streams. If we permit request or inbound access within a stateless firewall, the response or outbound access for the same request is not automatically permitted. We need to separately allow outbound access to be able to receive responses for a request. In AWS, Network Access Control Lists (NACLs) act as stateless firewalls.

## Security groups
Security groups act as a firewall at the instance level. Specifically, security groups operate at the network interface level.

- Only allow (permit) rules can be configured ‚Äî deny rules are not supported.
- There is an implicit deny at the end of every security group. If traffic doesn't match any allow rule, it is denied.
- All rules are evaluated until a match is found; if no match is found, traffic is denied.
- Security groups control both inbound (ingress) and outbound (egress) traffic.
- It acts as a "rule book" that can be attached to ENIs, which are in turn attached to resources like EC2 instances, Lambda (ENI-based), RDS, ECS, etc.
- What Can You Attach a Security Group To?

<details>

### ‚úÖ 1. EC2 Instances
SGs are most commonly attached to the ENIs of EC2 instances.

Each instance can have multiple SGs.

### ‚úÖ 2. ENI (Elastic Network Interface)
SGs are actually attached to ENIs, not directly to EC2.

EC2, Lambda, ECS tasks, etc. use ENIs internally.

### ‚úÖ 3. Lambda Functions (VPC-Enabled)
When a Lambda is deployed in a VPC, it gets an ENI.

You can assign Security Groups to that ENI to control access.

### ‚úÖ 4. RDS Instances & Aurora Clusters
RDS resources use SGs to control database access.

Even though you don‚Äôt see the ENI, it‚Äôs there under the hood.

<details>

### Use Case Example
You have:

- EC2 instance: needs access to RDS
- RDS: has a security group allowing inbound port 5432 from EC2's security group

This is SG-to-SG referencing, like:

```text
RDS SG rule:
  Allow inbound PostgreSQL (5432)
  Source: sg-ec2-instance
```
This means: ‚ÄúAllow inbound DB traffic from any instance that‚Äôs part of sg-ec2-instance‚Äù

</details>

### ‚úÖ 5. Elastic Load Balancers (ALB/NLB)
Security Groups are attached to ALBs (Application Load Balancers).

NLBs don‚Äôt use Security Groups unless they‚Äôre private and connected to internal targets.

### ‚úÖ 6. Amazon ElastiCache (Redis, Memcached)
SGs control which instances can access your cache clusters.

### ‚úÖ 7. Amazon Redshift
Redshift clusters can be placed in a VPC and have SGs attached.

### ‚úÖ 8. Amazon ECS (EC2 or Fargate with VPC Networking)
ECS tasks running with awsvpc networking mode get ENIs.
SGs are attached to those ENIs.

</details>

#### Custom security groups:
- No inbound rules by default ‚Üí all inbound traffic is denied.
- All outbound traffic is allowed by default.
#### Default security group:
- Allows inbound traffic from other instances associated with the same security group.
- Also allows all outbound traffic by default.

### üöÄ Features
- Stateful: If an inbound rule allows traffic, the return traffic is automatically allowed, even if there's no explicit outbound rule (and vice versa).
- You can reference another security group (or itself) in the source/destination field of rules.
- Security groups apply regardless of AZ or subnet ‚Äî they are VPC-scoped.
- You can modify security group membership or rules while instances are running.
- Up to 5 security groups can be assigned to each network interface of an EC2 instance.
- No limit on the number of EC2 instances that can be associated with a single security group.

<details>
Security groups are VPC-level virtual firewalls, and they are not "consumed" or "used up" when attached to EC2 instances. They act like policies, and EC2 instances reference them.

You can think of a security group like a "shared rulebook" ‚Äî many EC2 instances can follow the same rulebook.

For example:

You create a security group sg-webserver that allows inbound HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22).

You launch 100 EC2 instances, all web servers.

You attach the same sg-webserver to all 100 EC2 instances.
</details>

Changes to rules take effect immediately without rebooting the instance.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
You cannot block specific IP addresses with security groups ‚Äî use Network ACLs (NACLs) for that.

You cannot delete the default security group created with a VPC, though you can modify its rules.
## Network ACLs

Network ACLs (NACLs) function at the subnet level. The VPC router hosts the network ACL function.

### Rules

- With NACLs, you can have permit and deny rules.
- Network ACLs contain a numbered list of rules that are evaluated in order from the lowest number until the explicit deny.
- It is recommended to leave spacing between network ACL numbers.
- Network ACLs have separate inbound and outbound rules, and each rule can allow or deny traffic.
- NACLs only apply to traffic that is ingress or egress to the subnet, not to traffic within the subnet.

### Features

- Network ACLs are stateless, so responses are subject to the rules for the direction of traffic.
- A VPC automatically comes with a default network ACL, which allows all inbound/outbound traffic.
- All subnets must be associated with a network ACL. If you don‚Äôt do this manually, it will be associated with the default network ACL.
- You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets; however, a subnet can only be associated with one network ACL at a time.
- You can create custom network ACLs. By default, each custom network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules.
- Network ACLs do not filter traffic between instances in the same subnet. It is also recommended to have software firewalls installed on your instances.
- Changes to NACLs take effect immediately.

## What is meant by "Security Groups are stateful"?
I went to a movie with my son. During the film, he needed to go to the restroom.

The staff member at the door let him leave the theater and allowed him to re-enter afterwards. This is an example of a stateful request -- he went out and was allowed back in. However, somebody who simply tried to get into the theater would be rejected.

Similarly, your computer at home is connected to a router. The router protects it from the evils of the Internet. Traffic can't come through your router to your computer. However, if you make a request to go to a website, that request goes out of your router and the response is allowed back in because it is stateful. That is, the router remembers that you made the request to that website and it permits the response to come back to your computer.


### You have configured a Network ACL and a Security Group for the load balancer and Amazon EC2 instances to allow inbound traffic on port 80. However, users are still unable to connect to your website after launch.Which additional configuration is required to make the website accessible to all users over the internet?

A Network Access Control List (ACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC.

When you create a custom Network ACL and associate it with a subnet, by default, this custom Network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules. A network ACL has separate inbound and outbound rules, and each rule can either allow or deny traffic. Network ACLs are stateless, which means that responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to the rules for outbound traffic (and vice versa).

The client that initiates the request chooses the ephemeral port range. The range varies depending on the client's operating system. Requests originating from Elastic Load Balancing use ports 1024-65535. List of ephemeral port ranges:

Many Linux kernels (including the Amazon Linux kernel) use ports 32768-61000.

Requests originating from Elastic Load Balancing use ports 1024-65535.

Windows operating systems through Windows Server 2003 use ports 1025-5000.

Windows Server 2008 and later versions use ports 49152-65535.

A NAT gateway uses ports 1024-65535.

AWS Lambda functions use ports 1024-65535.
