## Internet Gateway (IGW):
An Internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the Internet.

It is not a physical device. Only one can be associated with each VPC. It does not limit the bandwidth of Internet connectivity. (The only limitation on bandwidth is the size of the Amazon EC2 instance, and it applies to all traffic — internal to the VPC and out to the Internet.)

If a VPC does not have an Internet Gateway, then the resources in the VPC cannot be accessed from the Internet (unless the traffic flows via a corporate network and VPN/Direct Connect).

An Internet Gateway allows resources within your VPC to access the internet, and vice versa. In order for this to happen, there needs to be a routing table entry allowing a subnet to access the IGW.
That is to say — **an IGW allows resources within your public subnet to access the internet, and the internet to access said resources.**

👉 *A subnet is deemed to be a Public Subnet if it has a Route Table that directs traffic to the Internet Gateway.*

```Lua 
In order for the resources in a VPC to send and receive traffic from the Internet, the following conditions must be met:

An Internet gateway must be attached to the VPC.
The route tables associated with your public subnet (including custom route tables) must have a route to the Internet gateway.
The security groups associated with your VPC must allow traffic to flow to and from the Internet.
Any instances in the VPC must either have a public IP address or an attached Elastic IP address.
```


## NAT Gateway
A NAT Gateway does something similar, but with two main differences:

1. It allows resources in a private subnet to access the internet (think yum updates, external database connections, wget calls, OS patch, etc).
2. It only works one way. The internet at large cannot get through your NAT to your private resources unless you explicitly allow it.
3. Security Groups cannot be associated with a NAT Gateway.
4. You’ll need one in each AZ (for high availability), since they only operate in a single AZ.
