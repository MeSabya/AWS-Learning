*A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network. A VPC peering connection helps you facilitate the transfer of data. You can create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs, or with a VPC in another AWS account. The VPCs can be in different regions (also known as an inter-region VPC peering connection).*

👉 You can create multiple VPC peering connections for each VPC that you own, but transitive peering relationships are not supported. You do not have any peering relationship with VPCs that your VPC is not directly peered with.

          Features:

          Limits are 50 VPC peers per VPC, up to 125 by request.
          DNS is supported.
          You can peer with other accounts (within or between regions).
          VPC peering connections cannot have overlapping CIDR ranges.
 
👉 You must update route tables to configure routing. It is also required to update the inbound and outbound rules for the VPC security group to reference security groups in the peered VPC. The VPC peering connection can be added to route tables. It shows as a target starting with pcx-.

👉 When creating a VPC peering connection with another account, you need to enter the account ID and VPC ID from the other account. You also need to accept the pending access request in the peered VPC.
