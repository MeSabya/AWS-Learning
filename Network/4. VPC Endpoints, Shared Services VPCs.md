# VPC Endpoints, 

*A VPC Endpoint is an ENI with a private IP address as an entry point for traffic destined to a supported service. It uses AWS PrivateLink. Using PrivateLink, you can connect your VPC to supported AWS services, services hosted by other AWS accounts (VPC endpoint services), and supported AWS Marketplace partner services.*

- Applications in an AWS VPC can securely access AWS PrivateLink endpoints across AWS Regions using Inter-Region VPC Peering.
- AWS PrivateLink allows you to privately access services hosted on AWS in a highly available and scalable manner, without using public IPs, and without requiring the traffic to traverse the Internet.
- Customers can privately connect to a service even if the service endpoint resides in a different AWS Region.
- Traffic using Inter-Region VPC Peering stays on the global AWS backbone and never traverses the public Internet.


      A gateway endpoint is a gateway that is a target for a for a route that you have specified in your route table. 
      It is used for traffic destined to a supported AWS service.
      
      An interface VPC endpoint (interface endpoint) enables you to connect to services powered by AWS PrivateLink.

ðŸ‘‰ **Know which services use interface endpoints and gateway endpoints. The easiest way to remember this is that gateway endpoints are for Amazon S3 and DynamoDB only.**

# Shared Services VPCs

VPC sharing enables subnets to be shared with other AWS accounts within the same AWS Organization. Benefits include:

- Separation of duties: centrally controlled VPC structure, routing, IP address allocation.
- Application owners continue to own resources, accounts, and security groups.
- VPC sharing participants can reference security group IDs of each other.
- Efficiencies: higher density in subnets, efficient use of VPNs, and AWS Direct Connect.
- Hard limits (for example, 50 VIFs per AWS Direct Connect connection through simplified network architecture) can be avoided.
- Costs can be optimized through the reuse of NAT gateways, VPC interface endpoints, and intra-Availability Zone traffic.
- You can create separate Amazon VPCs for each account, with the account owner being responsible for the connectivity and security of each Amazon VPC.
