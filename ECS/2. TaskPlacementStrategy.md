A task placement strategy is an algorithm for selecting instances for task placement or tasks for termination. When a task that uses the EC2 launch type is launched, Amazon ECS must determine where to place the task based on the requirements specified in the task definition, such as CPU and memory. Similarly, when you scale down the task count, Amazon ECS must determine which tasks to terminate. 

Task placement strategy types:

- **Binpack** – Place tasks based on the least available amount of CPU or memory. This minimizes the number of instances in use and allow you to be cost-efficient. 

- **Random** – Place tasks randomly. You use this strategy when task placement or termination does not matter.

- **Spread** – Place tasks evenly based on the specified value. Accepted values are attribute key-value pairs, instanceId, or host. Spread is typically used to achieve high availability by making sure that multiple copies of a task are scheduled across multiple instances. Spread across Availability Zones is the default placement strategy used for services.

- You can combine different strategy types to suit your application needs.
- Task placement strategies are a best effort.
- **By default, Fargate tasks are spread across Availability Zones.**
