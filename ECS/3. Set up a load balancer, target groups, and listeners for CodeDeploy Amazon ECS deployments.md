## Important Points 

- Before you run a deployment using the Amazon ECS compute platform, you must create an Application Load Balancer or a Network Load Balancer, two target groups, and one or two listeners. 

- One of the target groups directs traffic to your Amazon ECS application's original task set. The other target group directs traffic to its replacement task set. During deployment, CodeDeploy creates a replacement task set and reroutes traffic from the original task set to the new one. CodeDeploy determines which target group is used for each task set.

- A listener is used by your load balancer to direct traffic to your target groups. One production listener is required. You can specify an optional test listener that directs traffic to your replacement task set while you run validation tests.

- The load balancer must use a VPC with two public subnets in different Availability Zones.
