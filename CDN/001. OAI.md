## What is a cloudfront distribution?

A CloudFront distribution is an instance of the Amazon CloudFront content delivery network (CDN) service. 
It represents the configuration settings and content delivery behavior for a specific set of content, such as a website, web application, or media stream. 

### Here are the key components and aspects of a CloudFront distribution:

- Origin:

An origin is the source of the content that CloudFront delivers to end-users. It can be an Amazon S3 bucket, an Amazon EC2 instance, an Elastic Load Balancer, or a custom origin, such as an HTTP server.

- Behavior Settings:

CloudFront distribution settings include behaviors that define how CloudFront handles requests for different types of content. For example, you can set caching behavior, viewer protocol policy (HTTP or HTTPS), and other parameters.

- Cache Settings:

CloudFront allows you to configure caching settings to control how long CloudFront caches content at the edge locations. This includes Time To Live (TTL), cache behaviors, and cache control headers.

- Security Settings:

Security settings include options for enforcing HTTPS (SSL/TLS), using signed URLs or cookies for private content, and configuring access logs.

- Distribution Types:

CloudFront supports two main distribution types:
Web Distribution: Ideal for delivering static and dynamic web content, including images, videos, and HTML files.
RTMP Distribution: Designed for delivering streaming media content using the Adobe Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP).

- Edge Locations:

CloudFront has a global network of edge locations where content is cached. When a user requests content, CloudFront serves it from the edge location that provides the lowest latency.
Logging and Monitoring:

CloudFront provides logging options that allow you to capture detailed information about requests and configure Amazon S3 buckets to store logs.

You can monitor CloudFront distributions using Amazon CloudWatch to gain insights into metrics like request count, data transfer, and error rates.

- Customization:

CloudFront distributions offer customization options such as custom SSL certificates, custom error pages, and the ability to specify alternate domain names (CNAMEs).

## What is OAI in Cloudfront 

In Amazon CloudFront, OAI stands for Origin Access Identity. 
An Origin Access Identity is a special CloudFront user identity that you can associate with your Amazon S3 bucket to restrict access to your S3 content. 
This helps improve the security of your S3 content by ensuring that users can only access objects through CloudFront and not directly from the S3 bucket.

### Here's how OAI works in CloudFront:

#### Associating OAI with S3 Bucket:

When you create a CloudFront distribution and configure an S3 bucket as the origin, you have the option to associate an Origin Access Identity with that distribution.

When an OAI is associated with a distribution, CloudFront automatically creates a canonical user ID for the OAI.

#### Setting Permissions on S3 Bucket:

After associating an OAI with a CloudFront distribution, you need to update the S3 bucket's permissions. Specifically, you modify the bucket policy to grant read permission to the CloudFront OAI.

The bucket policy might look like the following:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "PolicyForCloudFrontPrivateContent",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::cloudfront:user/CloudFront Origin Access Identity DISTRIBUTION_ID"
      },
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
Replace DISTRIBUTION_ID and YOUR_BUCKET_NAME with your CloudFront distribution ID and S3 bucket name, respectively.

#### Effect on Access:

With the OAI associated with CloudFront, users are required to access your content through CloudFront. If they attempt to access the S3 bucket directly, they won't have the necessary permissions, improving the security of your S3 content.

#### Note on Custom Origins:

While OAI is commonly used with S3 origins, it's important to note that if you're using custom origins (non-S3 origins), OAI may not be applicable, and you would rely on the security mechanisms of the custom origin.
Using OAI with CloudFront is a recommended best practice for securing S3 content served through CloudFront. It ensures that your S3 bucket is not directly accessible to users, enhancing the overall security posture of your content delivery architecture.
