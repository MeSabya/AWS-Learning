## How EC2 can interact with S3 ..what is the permission/role we need on EC2 and on S3 
### Create an IAM Role for the EC2 Instance

Navigate to the IAM Management Console.

#### Create a New Role:

Choose “Roles” from the left menu and click “Create role.”
Select “EC2” as the trusted entity type (since you want to attach this role to an EC2 instance).
Attach Policies to the Role:

You need to attach a policy to this role that grants access to the S3 bucket. You can use managed policies like AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess for read-only access, or create a custom policy if you need more granular control.

Example Custom Policy for S3 Access:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
- Action: The actions you want to allow (e.g., s3:GetObject for reading objects, s3:PutObject for writing objects).
- Resource: The ARN of the S3 bucket and its objects.

Then Attach the IAM Role to Your EC2 Instance.

### S3 Bucket Permissions (Optional)
By default, S3 buckets are private and only accessible by the AWS account that created them. However, you can configure bucket policies to further control access. For example, if you want to allow only specific IAM roles or users to access the bucket, you can set up an S3 bucket policy.

Example S3 Bucket Policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::your-account-id:role/EC2S3AccessRole"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
- Principal: Specifies the IAM role or user that is allowed to perform actions.
- Action: Specifies the S3 actions allowed (e.g., s3:GetObject, s3:PutObject).
- Resource: The ARN of the S3 bucket and its objects.
