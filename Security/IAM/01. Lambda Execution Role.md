## Lambda Execution Role
- Purpose: This is a specific IAM role that AWS Lambda assumes when it executes your function.
- It allows Lambda to interact with other AWS services on your behalf.
- Scope: The permissions defined in this role determine what actions the Lambda function can perform (e.g., reading from an S3 bucket,
 writing to an SQS queue, logging to CloudWatch).
- Configuration: You specify the execution role when you create a Lambda function. Once attached, every time the Lambda function runs, it assumes this role.

***Example Use Case: If your Lambda function needs to read messages from an SQS queue and write logs to CloudWatch, 
the execution role must have sqs:ReceiveMessage and logs:CreateLogStream permissions.***
