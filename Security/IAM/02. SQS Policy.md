## SQS Policy

Purpose: An SQS policy is a resource-based policy that is directly attached to an Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) queue. 
It defines who can perform actions on the queue itself.

Scope: The SQS policy controls access to the specific SQS queue it is attached to. It can grant permissions to specific IAM users, 
roles, AWS accounts, or even external AWS accounts.

Configuration: You can attach a policy to an SQS queue to specify actions (e.g., sqs:SendMessage, sqs:ReceiveMessage) 
that different entities (like IAM roles, users, or AWS services) are allowed to perform on that queue.

***Example Use Case: If you want to allow another AWS account to send messages to your SQS queue, you would define an
SQS policy on the queue that grants the sqs:SendMessage permission to the external account.***

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Id": "QueuePolicy",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Allow-SendMessage",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"
      },
      "Action": "sqs:SendMessage",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:123456789012:MyQueue"
    }
  ]
}
```
## A real-time use case for SQS policies

A real-time use case for SQS policies typically involves scenarios where you need to control access to an SQS queue at a granular level, such as when different AWS accounts, services, or external entities need to interact with your SQS queue. Here are a few scenarios where SQS policies are particularly useful:

### 1. Cross-Account Access
Scenario: You own an SQS queue in your AWS account and want to allow another AWS account (such as a partner or a different team within your organization) to send messages to your queue.
How to Use: You would create an SQS policy that grants sqs:SendMessage permission to the specific AWS account ID. This policy is attached directly to the SQS queue.
Example:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"
      },
      "Action": "sqs:SendMessage",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:111122223333:MyQueue"
    }
  ]
}
```
Benefit: This allows the external account to send messages to your queue without giving them broader access to your AWS environment.

### 2. Service Integration with Limited Access
Scenario: Your SQS queue is being used by an application running on AWS Lambda, EC2 instances, or ECS tasks. However, you want to ensure that only these specific services can send or receive messages from the queue.
How to Use: You would define an SQS policy that allows only the IAM roles associated with these services to perform actions like sqs:SendMessage or sqs:ReceiveMessage on the queue.
Example:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::role/service-role/LambdaExecutionRole"
      },
      "Action": "sqs:ReceiveMessage",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:111122223333:MyQueue"
    }
  ]
}
```
Benefit: This limits access to the SQS queue only to the specific services you define, enhancing security and preventing unauthorized access.

### 3. Public Access for Specific Operations
Scenario: You want to allow public access to your SQS queue for specific operations like SendMessage, but with restrictions such as IP address whitelisting or other conditions.
How to Use: You can attach an SQS policy that allows actions like SendMessage from any principal (public access) but include conditions such as IP address restrictions.
Example:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "sqs:SendMessage",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:111122223333:MyQueue",
      "Condition": {
        "IpAddress": {
          "aws:SourceIp": "203.0.113.0/24"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
Benefit: This allows certain operations to be performed publicly, while still maintaining control over who can interact with your queue based on specific conditions.

### 4. External Integrations
Scenario: You are integrating with a third-party service that needs to send or receive messages from your SQS queue. The third-party service might not be in your AWS account.
How to Use: You would grant permissions to the third-party AWS account via an SQS policy, specifying the exact actions they are allowed to perform.
Example:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::444455556666:role/ExternalServiceRole"
      },
      "Action": "sqs:ReceiveMessage",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:111122223333:MyQueue"
    }
  ]
}
```
Benefit: This securely enables the third-party service to interact with your SQS queue without exposing other AWS resources.
